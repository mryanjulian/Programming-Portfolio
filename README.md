# Programming-Portfolio
This is a collection of coding samples including some magma code used in my research and some python solutions to project Euler problems.

The directory Project_Euler contains solutions to Project Euler problems written in Python.

The directory Magma_Programs contains programs I've created for my research, primarily dealing with coding theory and permutation groups.

The directory Python_Programs contains a selection of other programs written in Python for a variety of projects.
